# Modeling nonlinear differential equations with LSTMs

## Create data

- model nonlinear differential equations with a state space model
- use input data and the state space model to produce output data
- create datasets for LSTM training

## Defining different LSTM models

- maybe normal RNN for testing
- basic LSTM
- peephole LSTM

## Training LSTMs and compare different models

- keep hyperparameters for different models similar to just compare type of LSTM
- train models on datasets
- compare datasets and different models

## Priorities

- Literature review
    - different LSTM variants
    - neural networks to represent nonlinear sequential models
- set up whole pipeline first with one dataset, one LSTM model and test for bugs
- write down theory parts
- add more datasets and models depending on time left

## Questions

- python library for state space stuff or matlab needed? easy to find
- state space papers? email
- language? english or german 10-20 pages
- Latex template? ??
- presentation? yes
