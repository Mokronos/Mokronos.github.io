### Compiling

    make <program_name>

With file ending.


Make can be used to compile most files. Then one can execute them without file ending.

    ./<program_name>

### Basic C syntax

No need to go over this.

### Some more compiling

Make is essentially calling the language specific compilers. For C clang is called. With clang includes need to be manually added as an arument. Make does this automatically.

Compiling is generally done in multiple steps:
1. Preprocessing:
    - adding in includes and macros
    - removing comments
2. Compiling
    - converts code to assembly
3. Assembling
    - converts assembly to binary, which is maschine code and can be run on a CPU.
4. Linking
    - puts compiled includes in the binary code. No need to compile includes multiple times.

### Debugging

Bugs are errors in a program, so that it performs differently than expected. Finding and fixing these errors is called Debugging.
